# UrsaMajorStargate323
My efforts of preserving &amp; understanding this beautiful reverb

// This personal project is in no way affilliated or associated with Ursa Major Inc / Christopher Moore / Seven Woods Audio Inc / AKG

In 2019 I had the incredible opportunity to acquire an Ursa Major Stargate 323 in mint condition for a very affordable price.
The unit I bought previously belonged to the Institute of Musicology at the Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz and I really have to thank  Dr. Albert Gr√§f and his team at the Computer Music Research Group http://www.musikinformatik.uni-mainz.de/e_ag.php

Because this reverb is quite special and very rare, I'm doing everything I can to preserve it and share as much information about it, as possible.

Ursa Major Inc was founded by Christopher Moore in 1977 and sold to AKG in 1984. Christopher Moore's website is now at http://sevenwoodsdesign.com/index.html

Sean Costello from ValhallaDSP has a couple of interesting articles about Christopher Moore & the technology he used

I have to admit, that I am in a bit of a tight spot.
According to several comments on the first Valhalladsp article above, it is not possible to contact Christopher Moore via email anymore.
AKG doesn't seem to be actively working on any product under the Ursa Major brand.
Christopher Moore released a modern reissue of the SST-282, named SST-206, in 2003, which has long sold out.
Back when TDM was a thing, an SST-282 Plugin was available from Eventide https://www.eventideaudio.com/products/plugins/multitap-delay/sst-282-space-station which has now been discontinued.
I'd be more than happy to see an official continuation of the Ursa Major product line, but it doesn't look like this is going to happen anytime soon (if ever).

My goal is to preserve as much information about the Stargate 323 reverb, without causing damage to Chris Moore and the Ursa Major brand. I'm trying to navigate this thin line as good as I possibly can and if anybody has any suggestions, feel free to reach out.
